## 🎯 Overview

The **Holographic Code Playground** transforms coding into a spatial, visual experience. Write JavaScript (with Python support planned), and watch your variables and data structures—arrays, trees, or graphs—render as interactive 3D holograms. Step through your code with a time-travel debugger to see how it evolves, making it a powerful tool for learners, educators, and visual thinkers.

Built with modern web technologies, this project showcases advanced frontend skills, 3D graphics, and innovative developer tooling.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Code Editor**: Write JavaScript with real-time syntax highlighting powered by Monaco Editor (the engine behind VS Code).
- **3D Holograms**: Visualize arrays as cubes, trees as nodes, or custom structures in a rotatable 3D space using Three.js.
- **Time-Travel Debugger**: Step forward and backward through code execution to inspect state changes visually.
- **Shareable Snippets**: Save and share your creations via unique URLs.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and tablet screens.
